                    <p style=color:#777777>I didn't ask why my parents named me Summer until I was 7 years old. My
                        parents
                        had been seperated for as long as I could remember but my mother was more than happy to call my
                        father so they could both tell me the story. I was conceived on the first day of summer. Much to
                        my
                        7 year old dismay they took great joy in sharing too many details. That sums up my childhood.
                    </p>

                    <p style=color:#777777> By the end of the class I will be better at telling my story. Currently I
                        tend
                        to ramble and go on tangents about my cat. His name is Caesar. He was abandoned by his forest
                        family
                        when he got a horrid tick infection. He was hypothermic and weighed less than 1 lb when I found
                        him.
                        Now he is a 15 lb monster. </p>
